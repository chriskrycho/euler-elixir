# Euler in Elixir

My Project Euler solutions in Elixir.

You can look at these to your heart's content, but note well:

  1. I am using these to learn Elixir, and therefore make no promise that
     they're any kind of good at all.

  2. If you use these as answers, you'll short-circuit the actual value of doing
     Project Euler. Look at them *after* you do your own.
